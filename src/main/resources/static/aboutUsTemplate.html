    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>JAC Enterprises is an organization that specializes in offering niche adventures dedicated to learning about Earth's various ecosystems and unique terrains. Our motto is, "Vincit Qui Se Vincit" which means, "He/she conquers who conquers him/herself."
      JAC prides itself on educating all our customers on what adventures are provided and what can be expected on a chosen adventure. Past applications built highlighted JAC's Spelunking! and EYA! bka Experience Your Aquarium! and Just Trek adventures.
      Recently, JAC's island hopping business has had considerable interest thus creating substantial growth in bookings and revenue and thus JAC Enterprises has decided to open up a bidding/design competition to allow 3rd party consulting organizations to
      create an application that will educate current and future clientele of what island hopping is and island hopping adventures offered by JAC Enterprises.</p>
